##### And now a word from the lawyers...

Each and every thought on this blog is my own, I’m responsible for what I say, and all errors, idiocy, stupid comments, swear words, and humor are my own personal responsibility. These are my own thoughts, generated by me, representing me. They—and this blog—are in no way affiliated with any of my current or previous employers, or any company that I've been involved with. If I’ve made a mistake, it’s my fault. Of course, you should not rely on anything in the blog as legal, financial, accounting, investment, tax, or any other kind of regulated advice. All posts including examples on how to program, code, or use software tools are merely to provide ideas on what might be possible. Use what you learn here at your own risk! All computers have different state and certainly your production servers differ vastly from my own machine. Anything you see here and try out in production that breaks your business is not my fault. Feel free to comment on the my posts, however, be respectful and don't use an aggressive tone. Thank you!
